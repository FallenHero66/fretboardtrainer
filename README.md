# Fretboard Trainer
Fretboard Trainer helps you learn the layout of the guitar fretboard.

Check out Brendon D'Eon's video on the technique: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PMZWb6ZNJc

You can toggle between 6 and 7 strings, and between natural (7) tones or all (12) tones in the settings. Also, you can hide the "String" part so you can concentrate on a single string rather than jumping straight into random strings.
